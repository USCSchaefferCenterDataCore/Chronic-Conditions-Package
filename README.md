# Chronic-Conditions-Package
The purpose of the Chronic Conditions Package is to analyze claims data and flag the presence of chronic conditions based on user-defined criteria. There are three main criteria for identifying chronic conditions in the claims data: qualifying diagnosis codes, location of diagnosis codes (e.g. inpatient, outpatient, skilled nursing facility, etc.), and the reference period in which to find the diagnoses e.g. 2 years, 3 years). The final outputs will be yearly beneficiary level files with monthly condition and enrollment flags.
The package can also be applied to any other source of data where diagnosis and procedure information on patients during the analysis period is complete.
